## Suraksha Security Systems

### Problem Statement:

 Nowadays, the data and information has been the most treasured asset in any organization, university, banks etc. As the field of user-friendly technology and science is rapidly moving ahead,  there are lumps of data that is being generated every day. As a consequence, securing and privatizing this data has been a major concern which ensures the crimes being committed to remain at lower level. Due to varied hacking techniques that are being developed which rely on the vulnerability of various security systems, we need a hybrid security model that decreases the probability of a security breach.

### Prototype:
• Our project Suraksha is a sophisticated complex security system that aims at designing a system to securely grant access to confidential data by verifying the identity of a person amidst all the fraudulent scenarios .
• The user need to authenticate himself  under the guidance of our voice assistant  which includes biometric verification of face , voice and fingerprint.
• The verification of a user is succeeded only if the model recognizes the user at all levels of security.
• Incase of an un-authorization at any level of security , a security breach is suspected and the alert mechanism is activated.

### Tech-Stack:

 - Python 
 - OpenCV
 -  face_recognition
 - SMTP POSTFIX
 - speech_recognition
 - Fast2SMS API
 - Tkinter GUI
